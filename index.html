    <h1 style="color:white;">Ball Phython</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">The ball python (Python regius), also called the royal python, is 
a python species native to West and Central Africa, where it lives in 
grasslands, shrublands and open forests. This nonvenomous constrictor 
is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of
 182 cm (72 in). The name "ball python" refers to its tendency to curl 
into a ball when stressed or frightened.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Taxonomy</h2>
    <p style="color:white;">Boa regia was the scientific name proposed by George Shaw in 1802 
for a pale variegated python from an indistinct place in Africa. 
The generic name Python was proposed by François Marie Daudin in 1803 
for non-venomous flecked snakes. Between 1830 and 1849, several generic 
names were proposed for the same zoological specimen described by Shaw, 
including Enygrus by Johann Georg Wagler, Cenchris and Hertulia by John 
Edward Gray. Gray also described four specimens that were collected in 
Gambia and were preserved in spirits and fluid.</p>
    <h2 style="color:white;">Description</h2>
    <p style="color:white;">The ball python is black, or albino and dark brown with light brown 
blotches on the back and sides. Its white or cream belly is scattered with 
black markings. It is a stocky snake with a relatively small head and 
smooth scales.[3] It reaches a maximum adult length of 182 cm (6 ft 0 in). 
Males typically measure eight to ten subcaudal scales, and females typically
 measure two to four subcaudal scales. Females reach an average 
snout-to-vent length of 116.2 cm (45+3⁄4 in), a 44.3 mm (1+3⁄4 in) long jaw, 
an 8.7 cm (3+7⁄16 in) long tail and a maximum weight of 1.635 kg 
(3 lb 9.7 oz). Males are smaller with an average snout-to-vent length of 
111.3 cm (43+13⁄16 in), a 43.6 mm (1+23⁄32 in) long jaw, an 8.6 cm (3+3⁄8 in) 
long tail and a maximum weight of 1.561 kg (3 lb 7.1 oz). Both sexes 
have pelvic spurs on both sides of the vent. During copulation, males use 
these spurs for gripping females. Males tend to have larger spurs, and 
sex is best determined by manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a 
probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis.</p>
